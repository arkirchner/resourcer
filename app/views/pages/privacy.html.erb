<p>
The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not mine! — is a big deal to me. I will only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. I will never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to.
<%
  #I log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.

<h2>Identity & access</h2>

<p>
<%
  # When you sign up for Resourcer, we ask for your name, company name, and email address. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission, either.

  # When you pay for Resourcer, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.

<p>
When you write Resourcer with a question or to ask for help, I will keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse my marketing pages, I will track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). I also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.
</p>

<p>
The only times I will ever share your info:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission. <%= link_to "List of third-party services I use.", page_path("subprocessors") %></li>
  <li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our <%= link_to "Terms of Service", page_path("terms") %>, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
  <li>If Resourcer is acquired by or merged with another company — I don’t plan on that, but if it happens — I will notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</h2>

<p>You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, I recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information I gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> This is your right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Erasure.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the “Right to be forgotten”). However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using Resourcer services and may result in closing your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> This is your right to receive the personal information I have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact me at <a href="mailto:support@resourcer.work">support@resourcer.work</a>.</p>

<h2>Processors I use</h2>

<p>
As part of the services I provide, and only to the extent necessary, I may use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal information. For identification of these processors, and where they are located, please see our Subprocessor listing.
<%
  # We have signed appropriate data processing contracts that comply with GDPR with each processor."
%>
</p>

<h2>Law enforcement</h2>

<p>
I won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says I have to. I flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless I am legally prevented from it, I will always inform you when such requests are made.
</p>

<h2>Security & Encryption</h2>

<p>
All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" rel="nofollow">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted from our servers to your browser.
<%
  # The database backups are also encrypted.
%>
Data isn’t encrypted while it's live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but I go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
</p>

<h2>Deleted data</h2>

<%
  # When you cancel your account, we'll ensure that nothing is stored on our
  # servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active
  # will also be purged within 30 days (up until then it's available in the
  # trash can).
